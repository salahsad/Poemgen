haiku
"Arise from sleep, old cat, and with great yawns and stretchings...  Amble out for love A nursemaid scarecrow...  frightening the wind and sun From playing baby A saddening world: flowers whose sweet blooms must fall...  As we too, alas...  "
"Oh do not swat them...  unhappy flies forever Wringing their thin hands Showering onto Mount Kiso, the Milky Way. On the death of his child: Dew evaporates and all our world is dew...  So dear, So fresh, so fleeting "
"Standing still at dusk listen...  In far distances The song of froglings! Lightning flash, crash...  waiting in the bamboo grove See three dew-drops fall At furue in rain gray water and grey sand...  Picture without lines "
"Just by being, I'm here - in the snow-fall. Cries of wild geese, rumors spread about me. A frog and I, eyeball to eyeball. My empty face, betrayed by lightening. "
Clouds come from time to time - and bring to men a chance to rest from looking at the moon. In the cicada's cry There's no sign that can foretell How soon it must die. Won't you come and see loneliness? Just one leaf from the kiri tree. 
Slanting lines of rain...  on the dusty samisen A mouse is trotting A bright autumn moon...  in the shadow of each grass An insect chirping Old weary willows...  I thought how long the road would be When you went away 
"A short summer night...  but in this solemn darkness One peony bloomed Sadness at twilight...  villain! I have let my hand Cut that peony Rainy-month, dripping on and on as I lie abed...  Ah, old man's memories! "
Sadness at twilight...  villain! I have let my hand Cut that peony See the morning breeze ruffling his so silky hair...  Cool caterpillar A short summer night...  but in this solemn darkness One peony bloomed 
A short summer night...  but in this solemn darkness One peony bloomed Butterfly asleep folded soft on temple bell...  Then bronze gong rang! At furue in rain gray water and grey sand...  Picture without lines 
"Cold first winter rain...  poor monkey, you too could use A little woven cape Ah me! I am one who spends his little breakfast Morning-glory gazing Carven gods long gone...  dead leaves alone foregather On the temple porch "
"The laden wagon runs bumbling and creaking down the road...  Three peonies tremble Lightning flash, crash...  waiting in the bamboo grove See three dew-drops fall A bright autumn moon...  in the shadow of each grass An insect chirping "
"At furue in rain gray water and grey sand...  Picture without lines My two plum trees are so gracious...  see, they flower One now, one later The laden wagon runs bumbling and creaking down the road...  Three peonies tremble "
"Arise from sleep, old cat, and with great yawns and stretchings...  Amble out for love Live in simple faith...  just as this trusting cherry Flowers, fades, and falls Plume of pampas grass trembling in every wind...  Hush, my lonely heart "
At furue in rain gray water and grey sand...  Picture without lines White chrysanthemum...  before that perfect flower Scissors hesitate Deep in dark forest a woodcutter's dull axe talking...  And a woodcutter 
A short summer night...  but in this solemn darkness One peony bloomed See the morning breeze ruffling his so silky hair...  Cool caterpillar At furue in rain gray water and grey sand...  Picture without lines 
"A frog and I, eyeball to eyeball. My empty face, betrayed by lightening. The turnip farmer rose and with a fresh- pulled turnip...  Pointed to my road A gate made all of twigs With woven grass For hinges...  For a lock...  This snail "
"Oh former renter I know it all, all...  down to The very cold you felt Considerate dogs...  stepping off into the snow As I walk the path Now be a good boy take good care of our house...  Cricket my child "
"Standing still at dusk listen...  In far distances The song of froglings! Butterfly asleep folded soft on temple bell...  Then bronze gong rang! Rainy-month, dripping on and on as I lie abed...  Ah, old man's memories! "
"Summer shower - naked horse a naked rider. Arise from sleep, old cat, and with great yawns and stretchings...  Amble out for love A nursemaid scarecrow...  frightening the wind and sun From playing baby "
Sadness at twilight...  villain! I have let my hand Cut that peony Deep in dark forest a woodcutter's dull axe talking...  And a woodcutter Voices of two bells that speak from twilight temples...  Ah! Cool dialogue 
A camellia dropped down into still waters Of a deep dark well In the holy dusk nightingales begin their psalm...  Good! The dinner-gong! Butterfly asleep folded soft on temple bell...  Then bronze gong rang! 
A short summer night...  but in this solemn darkness One peony bloomed Standing still at dusk listen...  In far distances The song of froglings! Afternoon shower...  walking and talking in the street: Umbrella and raincoat! 
Slanting lines of rain...  on the dusty samisen A mouse is trotting Voices of two bells that speak from twilight temples...  Ah! Cool dialogue A short summer night...  but in this solemn darkness One peony bloomed 
The orphan speaks: the year-end party...  I am even envious Of scolded children Hi! Kids mimicking cormorants...  You are more like Real cormorants than They! Summer shower - naked horse a naked rider. 
A gate made all of twigs With woven grass For hinges...  For a lock...  This snail Oh do not swat them...  unhappy flies forever Wringing their thin hands A sudden shower falls - and naked I am riding on a naked horse. 
"Considerate dogs...  stepping off into the snow As I walk the path In this windy nest open your hungry mouth in vain...  Issa, stepchild bird In the city fields contemplating cherry-trees...  Strangers are like friends "
"In dim dusk and scent a witness now half hidden...  Evenfall orchid See the morning breeze ruffling his so silky hair...  Cool caterpillar Lightning flash, crash...  waiting in the bamboo grove See three dew-drops fall "
"Lightning flash, crash...  waiting in the bamboo grove See three dew-drops fall At furue in rain gray water and grey sand...  Picture without lines Rainy-month, dripping on and on as I lie abed...  Ah, old man's memories! "

"Cruel autumn wind cutting to the very bones...  Of my poor scarecrow Visiting the graves...  trotting on to show the way...  Old family dog Just by being, I'm here - in the snow-fall. "
"Good evening breeze! crooked and meandering Your homeward journey In this windy nest open your hungry mouth in vain...  Issa, stepchild bird I must turn over...  beware of local earthquakes Bedfellow cricket! "
Good friend grasshopper will you play the caretaker For my little grave? If strangers threaten turn into fat green bullfrogs...  Pond-cooling melons Considerate dogs...  stepping off into the snow As I walk the path 
Old weary willows...  I thought how long the road would be When you went away See the morning breeze ruffling his so silky hair...  Cool caterpillar A camellia dropped down into still waters Of a deep dark well

No oil to read by...  I am off to bed but ah!...  My moonlit pillow Lady butterfly perfumes her wings by floating Over the orchid Lightening - Heron's cry Stabs the darkness
